# Animal-Card-Complete
Completed Project 1 of Animal Trading Cards for IPND743 Class

This was a simple HTML project that has a picture of an animal, along with some information and facts about said animal.
The CSS stylesheet is linked to the HTML file. 
In order to see the picture, the picture file must be in the same folder as the html and and CSS file, since it is not a linked image.
