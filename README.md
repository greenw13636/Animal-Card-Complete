# Animal-Card-Complete
<h2>Completed Project 1 of Animal Trading Cards for IPND743 Class</h2>

This was a simple HTML project that has a picture of an animal, along with some information and facts about said animal.
+ The CSS stylesheet is linked to the HTML file with < link rel=stylesheet href=styles.css>

+ In order to see the picture, the picture file must be in the same folder as the html and and CSS file, since it is not a URL image.

<h1>Software Dependencies:</h1>

<h3>All these files must be present in the same folder:</h3>
